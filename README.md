The Login and Registration Form project aims to create a user authentication system where users can log in using their credentials or register for a new account. The project utilizes HTML for structuring the form, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for form validation and submission.
    
    
    User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing their desired username, email address, and password.
    Form Validation: The form validates user inputs to ensure that the required fields are filled correctly.
    Password Strength Meter: The password field includes a strength meter to indicate the strength of the user’s chosen password.
    Password Confirmation: The registration form includes a password confirmation field to ensure that users enter the same password twice.
    Error Handling: The form provides error messages to guide users in case of invalid inputs or missing fields.
    User Login: Existing users can log in using their registered username and password.
    Persistence: The project can be extended to include backend functionality to store and authenticate user credentials.
